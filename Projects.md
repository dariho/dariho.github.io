I am normally working on different projects in related/unrelated topics. Rather to be an "expert" on a single topic, I try to merge the knowdlegde 
and perspectives from different disciplines to bridge the gap. We are always open to [collaborate](mailto:darias.holgado@unil.ch) even in ongoing projects.

# Mental fatigue <-> Exercise
Here, we study how mental fatigue impact exercise, how exercise impact mental fatigue and how we can delay the onset of mental fatigue.
We are interesting in experimental studies as well as the anlysis of the literature.

- [Assessing the evidential value of the current literature of mental fatigue and exercise](https://osf.io/5zbyu/)
- [Can individualization of mental fatigue help?](https://osf.io/xc8nr/)
- [The effects of mental fatigue on objective and subjective indexes of sport performance](https://osf.io/s5tz6/)
- [Conceptual replication of "Mental fatigue impairs physical performance in humans"](https://osf.io/wqkap/)


# Transcranial direct current stimulation
Can we actually enhance exercise performance by stimulating the brain? The current evidence does not seem to support this notion. 
However, there has been an increasing number of meta-analysis in recent years, whereas the number of high quality primary studies not. 
- [**Meta-analysis**](https://osf.io/bh3g9/) and [**umbrella review**](https://osf.io/73qsu/) (on-going) of the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on of exercise performance

# Analgesics and exercise performance
Can analgesics like paracetamol, tramadol or glucocorticoids improve exercise performance? 
We are looking at if these substance has an ergogenic effect on exercise performance or if they could be harmfull for athletes.

- We have been funded by the WADA several times to carry out studies about the effect of [**tramadol**](https://osf.io/xbvt5/) and [**paracetamol**](https://osf.io/sbwx4/) on exercise and cognitive performance cognitive performance.
