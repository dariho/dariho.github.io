# About me
![Profile](/ldariho.github.io/home/Profile.jpg)

I completed my PhD entitled â€œExecutive functions, self-paced exercise and cycling performance". My main interest is to understand the cognitive and neural bases of exercise to bridge the gap between Sport Science, Psychology and Cognitive Neuroscience. During the PhD, I have worked on several articles on this topic. Moreover, I am interested in meta research.  In summary, I have tried not to specialize in any particular subject/discipline, but to unite the different perspectives.

Currently,  I am working as a "postdoc" at the University of Lausanne in Switzerland and the University of Granada in Spain. I am always open to collaborate if we have similar interests and vision of science.

I am a believer of Open Science (e.g., preregistration of studies, open access data), but it is not the only thing we could do better. 

Research is part of my life, but it is also baking, running, cycling and filming.
